# Getting Started

React wrappers for Core. Exports:
- Base `Kanva` component (which creates the `RootCanvasView` and manages it's children).
- `View` component
- `TextView` component
- `createReactView()` that wraps a View in React component.

## Next steps

This section is unfortunately still work in progress...
